# F.R.I.E.N.D.S-Scripts-Analysis

Hey there lobsters after all the hard work, the sweat, the frustration, the strain, and omg what not should I say. I have taken to complete this project was so surreal, I mean from data collection(WEB SCRAPING USING SELENIUM), cleaning the data, and to extract as many answers as I wanted and then loading them onto excel was so exciting and a bit why?, because although there were many data sources there was never like this one before, so inorder to put an end to this gap, I have taken up this challenge for myself and created this dataset and made it public so that everyone can enjoy from it,(Note: this type of dataset is not available on the internet, believe me, I tried a lot/maybe I didnâ€™t try hard enough, but I got this. 
So, after all the hard work, now is the time for tasting the dish that we have prepared, yes it is time to perform some Analysis and answers the question and prepare a cool dashboard too,, you know,,, to make yourself happy that you have used your unique skills and learned something from this project and being proud of yourself, that you have not only created this dataset, but also inspired people who are as passionate as you are to work on this, and if you guys have anything that you guys would like to know about the sitcom, the Data is yours, feel free to play with the data and know your answers.

But, before that, please give me credits for creating this data and for my friends who provided the scripts [(fangj.github.io)] and if you guys need all the step-by-step cleaning datasets which involve from web scraping to loading them onto excel, please feel free to contact me at Gmail: abhinayab54@gmail.com or we can connect on the linkdin [(https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinay-lingala-5a3ab7205/)] believe me, I'll reply within 48 hrs., ciao. 

Here is the Scraping code which I have built, I know this may be simple and not so precise but damn it took a lot of hours to build that exact piece of code to extract the information I needed.

Again please give me some tips on how to improve myself on this, watch out for other popular web series datasets coming in the future.
